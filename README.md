# Text Editor GUI 

A Text Editor built using Java uses JTextArea, JMenu, JMenuItems, and
JMenuBar to perform various tasks. It allows the user to enter, change, store,
and print text. It also has a file menu to make changes in files (like open, save,
close, and print) for future reference. and an edit menu to cut, copy and paste
texts. Also, it has a “Save and Submit” button to close the file after saving the
data. An actionListener is also used to detect actions in the project.

## Usage
